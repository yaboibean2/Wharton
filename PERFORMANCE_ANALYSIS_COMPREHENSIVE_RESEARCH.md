# Performance Analysis - Comprehensive Research Enhancement

## Issue Fixed
The system was detecting stocks with significant movements (15%+) but failing to find **any news articles** (0 articles for every stock), resulting in shallow AI analysis with only 1 generic root cause per stock.

## Root Cause
The `_fetch_news_for_stock()` method was looking for a `get_news()` method that doesn't exist in `EnhancedDataProvider`. The actual available methods are:
- `get_news_with_sources()` - Uses Perplexity AI + NewsAPI
- `get_news_sentiment()` - Gets sentiment analysis

Additionally, the AI prompts were not comprehensive enough and didn't demand specific, detailed analysis.

## Comprehensive Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced News Fetching (Multi-Strategy)
**File:** `utils/performance_analysis_engine.py` - `_fetch_news_for_stock()` method

Now uses **4 parallel strategies** to find news:

**Strategy 1: EnhancedDataProvider.get_news_with_sources()**
- Uses Perplexity AI for real-time web search
- Accesses NewsAPI for financial news
- Gets up to 15 articles with comprehensive coverage

**Strategy 2: Polygon.io Direct API**
- Direct REST API call to Polygon.io news endpoint
- Date-filtered search (start_date to end_date)
- Up to 15 recent articles with proper attribution

**Strategy 3: Perplexity AI Web Search**
- NEW: `_perplexity_news_search()` method
- Comprehensive web search across ALL financial sources
- Searches for 7 specific categories:
  1. Financial results (earnings, revenue, guidance)
  2. Business developments (partnerships, products, contracts)
  3. Corporate actions (management, buybacks, dividends)
  4. Analyst coverage (upgrades, downgrades, price targets)
  5. Market sentiment (short sellers, institutional flows)
  6. Sector dynamics (competition, market share)
  7. Macroeconomic impacts specific to the stock

**Strategy 4: Deduplication**
- Removes duplicate articles by title
- Sorts by relevance and date
- Returns top 15 unique articles

### 2. Enhanced AI Analysis Prompts

**Comprehensive Research Requirements:**
The AI prompt now DEMANDS extensive research across:

```
1. EARNINGS & FINANCIALS (Highest Priority)
   - Earnings reports, EPS beats/misses
   - Guidance revisions
   - Margin and profitability changes

2. ANALYST ACTIVITY (Critical)
   - Rating changes (upgrades/downgrades)
   - Price target revisions
   - New coverage initiations

3. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
   - Product launches, FDA approvals
   - Contracts, partnerships, M&A
   - Market share changes

4. CORPORATE ACTIONS
   - Management changes
   - Buybacks, dividends, splits
   - Insider trading

5. SECTOR & COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS
   - Industry trends
   - Competitor news
   - Regulatory changes

6. TECHNICAL & MARKET FACTORS
   - Short squeezes
   - Options/institutional flows
   - Technical breakouts

7. MACROECONOMIC IMPACT
   - Fed policy effects
   - Currency/commodity exposure
   - Geopolitical impacts
```

**Mandatory Specificity:**
The JSON response now requires:
- **Root causes:** Minimum 3-5 specific reasons with DATES and NUMBERS
  - Example: "Q3 earnings beat on Oct 5: EPS $2.50 vs $2.10 est, revenue up 25%"
  - Example: "JPMorgan upgraded to Overweight on Oct 8, PT raised to $150"
- **Catalyst summary:** 3-4 sentences with specific events, dates, analyst names, metrics
- **Agent relevance:** Specific analysis for each agent (not generic)
- **Model gaps:** Specific improvements needed (not vague suggestions)

### 3. Model Selection Enhancement

**OpenAI (gpt-4):**
- Standard financial analysis
- Temperature: 0.2 (more factual)
- Max tokens: 2500 (more detailed)

**Perplexity (sonar-pro):**
- Real-time web search capabilities
- Searches across financial news, analyst reports, earnings transcripts
- Custom system message emphasizing web search and specificity
- Temperature: 0.2
- Max tokens: 2500

### 4. Fallback Improvements

If AI fails, the fallback analysis now:
- Checks for news articles count
- Analyzes volume changes
- Provides meaningful heuristics
- Returns structured data matching expected format

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### News Fetching
```
Before:
âœ— Fetched 0 news articles for NVTS
âœ— Fetched 0 news articles for GSRT
âœ— Fetched 0 news articles for MP

After:
âœ“ Fetching news for NVTS using get_news_with_sources...
âœ“ Found 12 articles via get_news_with_sources
âœ“ Using Perplexity AI for comprehensive NVTS research...
âœ“ Found 8 insights via Perplexity AI
âœ“ Total fetched: 15 news articles for NVTS
```

### AI Analysis
```
Before:
Completed analysis for NVTS: 1 root causes identified
Root cause: "Stock moved due to market factors"

After:
Completed analysis for NVTS: 5 root causes identified
Root causes:
1. "Q3 earnings beat on Oct 5, 2025: EPS $1.85 vs $1.45 est (+27%), revenue $420M vs $380M est (+10%)"
2. "Goldman Sachs upgraded from Neutral to Buy on Oct 7, PT raised from $10 to $15 (+50%)"
3. "Major DoD contract worth $200M announced Oct 3 for satellite communication systems"
4. "Short interest decreased 40% week of Oct 1-8, potential short squeeze contributed to rally"
5. "Sector-wide defense/aerospace rally following increased federal budget allocation"
```
