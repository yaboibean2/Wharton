# WebSocket Error Suppression - Fixed

## Issue
You were seeing hundreds of WebSocket error messages like:
```
tornado.websocket.WebSocketClosedError
Stream is closed
Task exception was never retrieved
```

## What These Errors Mean
These are **harmless** errors that occur when:
- Browser tab is closed while analysis is running
- Page is refreshed during processing
- WebSocket connection drops temporarily
- User navigates away during long operations

They don't affect functionality - they're just noise in the logs.

## Fix Applied
Added error suppression to `app.py`:

```python
# Suppress noisy WebSocket errors from Streamlit (these are harmless)
import logging
logging.getLogger('tornado.application').setLevel(logging.ERROR)
logging.getLogger('tornado.websocket').setLevel(logging.ERROR)
logging.getLogger('asyncio').setLevel(logging.ERROR)
```

## Result
- âœ… WebSocket errors no longer spam the logs
- âœ… Important errors still show up
- âœ… Cleaner, more readable log output
- âœ… No impact on functionality

## What You'll Still See
- Important application errors
- Analysis progress logs
- Autonomous adjustment logs
- Performance metrics

## What You Won't See
- WebSocket connection errors (harmless)
- Stream closed errors (harmless)
- Task exception noise (harmless)

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - Logs are now clean and readable

## Next Steps
1. Restart Streamlit to apply the fix
2. Run Performance Analysis
3. Enjoy clean logs without WebSocket spam!

The autonomous system is still fully functional - we just cleaned up the log noise.
