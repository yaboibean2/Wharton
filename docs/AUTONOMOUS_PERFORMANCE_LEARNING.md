# Autonomous Performance Learning System - Complete Implementation

## 🤖 AUTONOMOUS MODEL ADJUSTMENT

The system now **automatically adjusts itself** based on performance analysis. No manual intervention needed!

### What It Does Automatically

#### 1. **Agent Weight Adjustment**
- Analyzes which agents missed opportunities
- Increases weights for agents that should have caught movements
- Saves adjustments to `config/model.yaml` (with automatic backup)

Example:
```
Sentiment agent missed 40% of news-driven moves
→ Automatically increases sentiment_agent weight from 1.0 to 1.20 (+20%)
```

#### 2. **Threshold Adjustment**
- Adjusts scoring thresholds based on confidence levels
- Makes system more/less aggressive based on accuracy

Example:
```
Average confidence is 80%+ (high accuracy)
→ Lowers upside_minimum from 0.15 to 0.12 (more aggressive)
→ Lowers conviction_threshold from 70 to 65
```

#### 3. **Feature Focus Adjustment**
- Identifies which features drive movements
- Adjusts feature importance dynamically

Example:
```
45% of moves were earnings-related
→ Sets earnings_monitoring: 'high_priority'
→ Sets earnings_surprise_weight: 1.5
```

### How It Works

```
1. System detects significant stock movements (up AND down)
2. AI analyzes root causes for each movement
3. System evaluates which agents should have caught each move
4. Calculates optimal weight adjustments
5. AUTOMATICALLY applies changes to config/model.yaml
6. Creates backup of old config
7. Logs all changes for transparency
```

### Log Output Example

```
🤖 AUTONOMOUS ADJUSTMENT: Analyzing performance patterns...
   Patterns detected: {
     'earnings_frequency': 0.42,
     'news_driven_frequency': 0.38,
     'sector_driven_frequency': 0.15
   }

✅ Applied agent weight adjustments:
   value: 1.00 → 1.15 (+15%)
   sentiment: 1.00 → 1.20 (+20%)
   growth_momentum: 1.00 → 1.10 (+10%)

✅ Applied threshold adjustments:
   upside_minimum: 0.15 → 0.12
   conviction_threshold: 70 → 65

✅ Identified feature focus changes:
   earnings_monitoring: 'high_priority'
   news_sentiment_weight: 1.3

✅ Updated agent weights in config/model.yaml (backup: config/model.yaml.backup.20251014120530)

🎯 AUTONOMOUS ADJUSTMENT COMPLETE: 3 adjustments applied
```

## 📊 UP AND DOWN MOVEMENT ANALYSIS

The system now clearly tracks BOTH directions:

### Enhanced Logging
```
🎯 ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Identified 23 significant movements from 105 stocks (threshold: 15.0%)
   📈 17 stocks moved UP  |  📉 6 stocks moved DOWN

✅ Top GAINERS: NVTS (+57.4%), GSRT (+51.0%), MP (+44.8%)
❌ Top LOSERS: QUBT (-12.1%), VRAR (-8.1%), RLYB (-7.6%)
```

### Why This Matters

**Up Movements:**
- Identify opportunities model missed
- Learn from winning stocks
- Adjust for bullish catalysts

**Down Movements:**
- Identify risks model missed
- Learn from failing stocks
- Improve risk detection
- Avoid future losses

Both are equally important for model improvement!

## 🎯 AUTONOMOUS ADJUSTMENT LOGIC

### Agent Weight Calculation

```python
IF agent missed >30% of relevant opportunities:
    weight_increase = 0.10 + (miss_rate - 0.30) * 0.5
    new_weight = 1.0 + min(0.25, weight_increase)

Examples:
- Missed 35%: +12.5% weight (1.125x)
- Missed 50%: +20% weight (1.20x)
- Missed 70%: +25% weight (1.25x, capped)
```

### Pattern-Based Adjustments

```python
IF >40% earnings-related:
    value_weight = 1.15x
    growth_momentum_weight = 1.10x

IF >40% news-driven:
    sentiment_weight = 1.20x

IF >30% sector-driven:
    macro_regime_weight = 1.15x

IF >20% extreme moves:
    risk_weight = 1.10x
```

### Threshold Adjustments

```python
IF average_confidence > 75% (high accuracy):
    upside_minimum: 0.15 → 0.12 (more aggressive)
    conviction_threshold: 70 → 65

IF average_confidence < 50% (low accuracy):
    upside_minimum: 0.15 → 0.20 (more conservative)
    conviction_threshold: 70 → 75
```

- One-click "Run Analysis & Auto-Adjust"

#### Tab 2: "📊 Portfolio Tracking"
- Combines Dashboard + Tracked Tickers + Complete Archives
- Unified view of all recommendations and performance
- Current prices, performance, outcomes

#### Tab 3: "📈 Reviews & Export"
- Weekly Reviews
- Export functionality
- Manual review and feedback

### Benefits
- Simpler, more intuitive
