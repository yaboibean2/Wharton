# Performance Analysis: Worksheet Configuration Fix

## THE PROBLEM

The error shows:
```
Using first worksheet: 'Year by year'
ERROR: the header row in the worksheet contains duplicates: ['']
```

**Root Cause**: The system is reading the WRONG worksheet ("Year by year" instead of "Historical Price Analysis"), and that worksheet has empty/duplicate column headers.

## THE FIX

### 1. Create the Correct Worksheet

You need a worksheet named one of these (in priority order):
1. **"Historical Price Analysis"** ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
2. "Portfolio Analysis"
3. "Price Analysis"

### 2. Required Columns

Your worksheet MUST have:

**Option A (Recommended):**
- `Ticker` - Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, TSLA)
- `Percent Change` - Movement since analysis (e.g., 58.97, 50.97, -18.5)

**Option B (Alternative):**
- `Ticker` - Stock symbol
- `Price at Analysis` - Starting price (e.g., 100.50)
- `Price` - Current price (e.g., 159.47)

### 3. Example Worksheet Setup

Create a new worksheet named "Historical Price Analysis" with this structure:

| Ticker | Percent Change | Price at Analysis | Price | Sector | Market Cap |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------|---------|------------|
| AAPL   | 58.97         | 100.25            | 159.47| Tech    | 2.5T       |
| NVDA   | 50.97         | 450.30            | 679.76| Tech    | 1.8T       |
| TSLA   | 45.08         | 225.50            | 327.17| Auto    | 800B       |
| INTC   | -22.15        | 45.80             | 35.66 | Tech    | 150B       |

**Important:**
- Column names must be in the FIRST row
- No empty column headers
- No duplicate column headers
- Data starts in row 2

### 4. What You'll See After Fix

```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Year by year" worksheet being read

**Problem**: The system can't find "Historical Price Analysis", so it's trying to use the first worksheet.

**Solution**: 
1. Create a new worksheet
2. Name it exactly: **Historical Price Analysis**
3. Or rename your current working worksheet to this name

### Issue: "Duplicate header" error

**Problem**: Your worksheet has:
- Empty column headers (blank cells in row 1)
- Duplicate column names

**Solution**:
1. Go to row 1 of your worksheet
2. Delete any empty columns
3. Ensure every column has a unique name
4. Remove any spaces from end of column names

### Issue: "Missing required 'Ticker' column"

**Problem**: First row doesn't have a "Ticker" column

**Solution**:
- Add "Ticker" as the first column header
- Ensure spelling is exact (capital T)

### Issue: "Missing required data columns"

**Problem**: No percent change or price columns

**Solution**:
Add either:
- Column: "Percent Change"
- OR Columns: "Price at Analysis" + "Price"
