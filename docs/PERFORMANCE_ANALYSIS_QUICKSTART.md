- Focus on 1-2 recommendations at a time
- Build momentum gradually

### 2. Track Everything
- Document what you implement
- Note the date of implementation
- Monitor results for 2-4 weeks

### 3. Look for Patterns
- Which types of movements are most common?
- Are earnings-related moves more predictable?
- Which agents need the most improvement?

### 4. Be Consistent
- Set a weekly reminder (Monday morning?)
- Make it part of your routine
- Compound improvements over time

## 🎯 First Week Action Plan

### Monday
- Run 7-day performance analysis
- Review executive summary
- Identify top 3 recommendations

### Tuesday
- Deep-dive into top recommendation
- Plan implementation approach
- Gather any needed resources

### Wednesday-Thursday
- Implement recommendation #1
- Test and validate changes
- Mark as implemented

### Friday
- Implement recommendation #2 if time allows
- Document learnings
- Plan next week's improvements

### Weekend

- Prepare for next analysis

## ⚡ Quick Commands Reference

### Run Analysis
```
Time Period → Select range → Run Performance Analysis
```

### View Specific Movers
```
Results → Top Gainers/Losers → Expand stock → Review analysis
```

### Act on Recommendations
```
Results → Recommendations → Expand → Review → Mark as Implemented
```

```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No significant movements found"
**Solution:** Expand date range to 14 or 30 days

### "Analysis taking too long"
**Solution:** Normal for first run (fetching news). Subsequent runs use cache.

### "No recommendations generated"
**Solution:** Need more data points. Analyze more stocks first.

### "AI analysis failed"
**Solution:** Check API keys in System Configuration
