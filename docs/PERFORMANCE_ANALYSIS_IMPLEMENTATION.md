# Performance Analysis Engine - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A **comprehensive, robust learning system** that automatically analyzes stock performance, identifies root causes of movements, and generates specific model improvement recommendations.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. PerformanceAnalysisEngine Class
**Location:** `utils/performance_analysis_engine.py`

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Detects significant stock price movements (up/down)
- ✅ Fetches news articles from Polygon.io API
- ✅ Uses AI (OpenAI GPT-4 or Perplexity) for root cause analysis
- ✅ Generates prioritized, actionable model recommendations
- ✅ Tracks implementation and improvement over time

### 2. Data Structures
- `StockMovement`: Captures price movement details
- `NewsArticle`: Stores news article data
- `MovementAnalysis`: Comprehensive analysis of why a stock moved
- `ModelAdjustmentRecommendation`: Specific improvement recommendations

### 3. Analysis Workflow

**Step 1: Movement Detection**
- Scans tracked stocks for significant price changes
- Classifies as "significant" (>5%), "major" (>10%), or "extreme" (>20%)
- Captures volume changes and fundamental data

**Step 2: News Fetching**
- Integrates with Polygon.io News API
- Fetches relevant articles for each mover
- Extracts titles, descriptions, sources, and keywords

**Step 3: AI Root Cause Analysis**
- Sends movement + news + fundamentals to AI
- AI analyzes and returns structured JSON:
  - Root causes (primary drivers)
  - Confidence score
  - Category flags (earnings/news/market/sector/fundamental/technical)
  - Agent relevance (which agents should have caught this)
  - Model gaps (what was missed)

**Step 4: Recommendation Generation**
- Analyzes patterns across all movements
- Identifies common issues and opportunities
- Generates specific recommendations with:
  - Priority level (critical/high/medium/low)
  - Category (agent_weight/feature_focus/data_source/threshold)
  - Specific change to make
  - Detailed rationale with evidence
  - Implementation steps
  - Confidence score

**Step 5: Tracking**
- Saves all results to JSON files
- Tracks which recommendations are implemented
- Monitors impact over time

### 4. UI Integration
**Location:** `app.py` - QA & Learning Center → Performance Analysis tab

**Features:**
- ✅ Time period selection (preset or custom range)
- ✅ One-click analysis execution
- ✅ Beautiful results display:
  - Executive summary
  - Key metrics dashboard
  - Top gainers/losers with expandable details
  - Root cause analysis for each stock
  - Model improvement recommendations
  - Pattern analysis across all movements
- ✅ Recommendation management:
  - Filter by priority
  - View implementation steps
  - Mark as implemented
  - Track over time

## 📊 Example Output

### Top Gainer Example
```
#1 NVDA (+15.25%) - MAJOR
Price: $450.00 → $518.62
Volume: +85% above average

Root Cause Analysis:
Catalyst: Strong earnings beat with AI chip demand exceeding expectations. 
         Guidance raised significantly for Q4.
Confidence: 92%

Primary Drivers:
• Exceptional Q3 earnings beat (EPS $5.15 vs $4.85 expected)
• Data center revenue up 180% YoY
• Strong AI demand outlook with new product launches
• Multiple analyst upgrades post-earnings

Flags: 📊 Earnings | 📰 News | 📈 Fundamental
```

### Model Recommendation Example
```
🚨 [CRITICAL] Tighten risk controls for high-volatility stocks

Category: threshold
Rationale: 3 stocks had extreme movements (>20%). Risk agent needs to 
          better identify high-volatility situations.
Expected Impact: Reduced exposure to extreme volatility; better downside protection
Confidence: 90%

Implementation Steps:
1. Add implied volatility screening
2. Implement position size limits for high-beta stocks
3. Monitor options market for volatility signals
4. Add stop-loss recommendations

Affected Agents: risk

Supporting Evidence:
• NVDA: +15.25% move
• TSLA: -18.50% move
• META: +22.10% move
```
